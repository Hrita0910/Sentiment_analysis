# Sentiment_analysis

Social media sentiment analysis is the process of collecting and analyzing information on the emotions behind how people talk about your brand on social media. Rather than a simple count of mentions or comments, sentiment analysis considers feelings and opinions.

In this project, I have performed various techniques like:

## Data Preprocessing
Cleaning Text Data: Removed special characters, URLs, and punctuation using regular expressions. Converted text to lowercase to ensure uniformity.
Tokenization: Split the cleaned text into individual words or tokens for analysis.
Stop Words Removal: Eliminated common words (like "and," "the," etc.) that do not contribute significant meaning to sentiment analysis.
Stemming/Lemmatization: Reduced words to their base or root form to unify variations (e.g., "running" to "run").
Handling Missing Values: Checked for and addressed any missing data entries to ensure a complete dataset.
## Data Visualization
Distribution of Sentiments: Visualized the sentiment distribution (positive, negative, neutral) using bar charts or pie charts to understand overall sentiment trends.
Word Clouds: Created word clouds to highlight frequently used terms in positive and negative sentiments, providing insights into common themes.
Time Series Analysis: Analyzed tweet trends over time, potentially using line charts to track sentiment fluctuations throughout specific periods.
## Model Building
Feature Extraction: Converted the cleaned text data into numerical features using techniques like TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) or Word Embeddings.
Model Selection: Chose appropriate machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, or more advanced models like LSTM) for sentiment classification.
Training and Testing: Split the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance. Trained the selected model on the training set and validated its accuracy using the testing set.
## Model Evaluation: 
Assessed the model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to determine its effectiveness in predicting sentiments.
These steps collectively provide a robust framework for analyzing sentiments from social media data, facilitating insights into public opinion and trends.
